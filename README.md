**`QA Automator Engineer | Fan of technology and video games`**

- ðŸ¤– I'm a QA Tester graduated from "Jovenes a Programar" in 2022 with experience in test automation. 
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in different types of testing to advance my professional career.  In the future I would like to learn about video game development and testing
- ðŸ’– Due to my passion for video games since I was a child, I also developed a love for technology. I embarked on my computing journey, delving into hardware and challenging myself with a project to build my own  gaming PC piece by piece. Inspired by this experience, I decided to dive deeper into software development, and now I find myself in a fulfilling career where continuous learning is the norm.
