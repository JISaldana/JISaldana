**`QA Automator Engineer | Fan of technology and video games`**

- ðŸ¤– I'm a Junior QA Tester with recent experience in test automation. My passion for technology led me to choose a career in the field of computer science, and I decided to enter the testing area because of my curiosity and great attention to detail.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in different types of testing to advance my professional career.  In the future I would like to learn about video game development and testing
